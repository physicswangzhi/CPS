# Simple Junction: {\it Matsubara Formalism}

First we consider tunneling current in the textbok. First, we repeat his derivation following Mahan's Book, in **page 85, page 207 and page 789**. The Hamiltonian of the junction writes as,
$$
H=H_{R}+H_L+H_T=H_0+H_T
$$

with the Hamiltonians for the left side,
$$
H_R =\sum_{\sigma,{\bf k}} \xi_{\bf k} c^{\dagger}_{\sigma,{\bf k}}c_{\sigma,{\bf k}}
+
\sum_{\bf k} \Delta_R (c^{\dagger}_{{\bf k},\uparrow} c^{\dagger}_{{\bf -k},\downarrow}+ c_{{\bf k},\downarrow} c_{{\bf -k},\uparrow})
$$
