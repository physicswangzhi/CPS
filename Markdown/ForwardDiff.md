## FowardDiff.jl

Read the JuliaDiff website to understand the advantages (and some of the implementation) of autodifferentiation

### Problem

Use Optim.jl to optimize [Hosaki's Function](http://al-roomi.org/benchmarks/unconstrained/2-dimensions/58-hosaki-s-function)

Improve Optim.jl's timing by providing functions for the gradient and Hessian using ForwardDiff.jl
