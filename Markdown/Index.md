## Electron Tunneling Phenomenon

Besides the study of the transport in bulk materials, the investigation of nano-scale system becomes important. These systems have a tunneling mechanism and conductance (instead of conductivity) is important. 

In this note, we will discuss the  Josephson junctions in which Cooper pair splitting shows up. We begin from a review of the tunneling calculations in the formalism of Green function expression.
